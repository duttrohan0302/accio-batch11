- It can be used together with useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.
- We want to avoid the problem of creating multiple props to pass data down two or more levels from a parent component
- For this, we use React context
- React.Context Consumer adds extra nesting, to avoid that, we use useContext hook

## useReducer Hook
- What a reducer is?
- Fancy word for a function that takes 2 values and returns 1 value
