## Object Oriented Programming

- Focuses on classes and objects

### Principles of OOP
1. Inheritance - Child Classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class
2. Encapsulation - Containing information in an object(both methods and attributes in a single template), exposing oly selected information
3. Abstraction - Only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object
4. Polymorphism - Many methods can do the same task


### Building Blocks of OOPS
- Classes
- Objects
- Methods
- Attributes

What can a class contain?
1. Attributes - properties
2. Methods - functions
